# ML-Projects

This repository contains several machine learning projects developed by me with a massive contribution from people in ML community. Each project focuses on different aspects of machine learning, showcasing a variety of techniques and approaches. Below is a brief overview of the projects available in this repository:

### 1. COVID-19 Prediction from Chest X-Ray using CNN
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict COVID-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of X-ray images to identify patterns associated with the virus.

### 2. Computer Vision (CV)
This section of the repository contains computer vision-related papers and there implementations (Datasets used in model training/validation are not attached in this repository).

#### Classification

* [ViT - An Image Is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers For Image Recognition At Scale](CV/Classification/VisionTransformer/)

#### Generative Adversarial Networks

* [DCGAN - Unsupervised Representation Learning With Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](CV/GANs/DCGAN/)
* [Pix2Pix - Image-To-Image Translation With Conditional Adversarial Networks](CV/GANs/Pix2Pix/)
* [StyleGAN - A Style-Based Generator Architecture For Generative Adversarial Networks](CV/GANs/StyleGAN/)
* [Image Inpainting - Generative Image Inpainting with Contextual Attention](CV/GANs/Inpainting/)
* [StackGAN - Text to Photo-realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks](CV/GANs/StackGAN/)

#### Segmentation

* [PSPNet- Pyramid Scene Parsing Network](CV/Segmentation/PSPNet/)
* [U-Net - Convolutional Networks For Biomedical Image Segmentation](CV/Segmentation/UNet/)
* [YOLO - You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection](CV/Segmentation/YOLO/)
* [PointNet - Deep Learning on Point Sets For 3D Classification And Segmentation](CV/Segmentation/PointNet/)

### 3. English to French Translation with LSTM Neural Network
In this project, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network is implemented for English to French translation. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequential data, making them ideal for translation tasks.

### 4. Stock News Prediction using NLP Tweets Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on stock market predictions by analyzing sentiment in tweets related to specific stocks. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to perform sentiment analysis on tweets, which is then used to predict stock market trends.
