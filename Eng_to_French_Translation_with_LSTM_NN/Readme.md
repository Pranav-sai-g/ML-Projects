# English to French Translation with LSTM Neural Network
This project focuses on translating English sentences into French using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network. It's a journey into the world of sequence-to-sequence tasks and language translation.

## Overview
This repository contains all the code and resources for my English to French translation project. I've implemented the LSTM model for its suitability in handling the intricacies of language translation.

## Requirements
To run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
NumPy
Pandas

Acknowledgments
This project wouldn't have been possible without the inspiration and guidance from various sources.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or provide feedback. Let's make language translation awesome together!
